                            We all know what it’s like to scroll through an online menu or physical menu that’s nothing but dish names
                            and text descriptions. It works, but it’s certainly not ideal. How often have you wished you
                            could pull up a picture of the items you’re interested in?
                            As a restauranteur you understand better than most how powerful that would be. That one, single
                            feature would endear your customers to you and draw in many more. If you ran the only pizza and sub
                            shop in the area that featured a dynamic, fully-visual menu, people would favor you over the competition.
                            And they would recommend you to friends.
                            This is what you get with VIZHO͞OƏLS (visuals). Easy to create, high-resolution,
                            fully-visual menus that patrons can use both online and in restaurant. With no app download required.
                            Your menu presents in their regular web browser. Read on to discover what this can do for your business.

                            to adding them to your visual menu can be done entirely with your smartphone. In nearly no time you
                            can set up an exciting visual menu that your customers will love.
                            And your menu can be updated whenever you like. Any time you add or remove menu items simply enter the
                            app and make your changes. The new menu will be instantly accessible to your customers.

                            Our dynamic visual menu is entirely filterable and searchable. If a customer only wants
                            to see images of the different burgers you sell, they can do that. They can filter to see
                            only dessert items, or menu items under a particular price. Your patrons will love the flexibility
                            your visual menu will provide them.

                            It’s easy to include a link to your menu on your website.
                            This can be done in place of your normal online menu or as a
                            complement to it. Having both will give your customers more options
                            and let them search your menu however they prefer. Customers appreciate choice.

                            We integrate NFC and QR Code technology to let customers quickly and easily pull up
                            your visual menu on their cell phone while at your restaurant. Add a QR code to your
                            physical menu. Then all a customer needs to do is scan it with their mobile device’s camera
                            and your visual menu will appear in their phone’s browser. Or place an NFC tag on your counter, or at
                            each table. Simply bringing their phone near the tag will load the menu on your customer’s phone.

                            Both of these technologies make loading your visual menu incredibly simple. Your online visual menu becomes
                            an instant extension of your physical menu. Customers could be browsing your paper menu and then quickly jump
                            to your visual menu to see a picture of the dish they’re thinking about ordering. It gives them far more information
                            than a printed menu, or most online menus can convey.
